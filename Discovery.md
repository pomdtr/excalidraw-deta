## What is it?

Excalidraw is a free, open-source, whiteboard that lets you easily sketch diagrams that have a hand-drawn feel to them. It's a great tool for sketching wireframes, UI mockups, and more.

Excalidraw Deta is an **unofficial** version of Excalidraw that is integrated to your Deta Workspace.

## How does it differ from the [Excalidraw.com](https://excalidraw.com) ?

The original Excalidraw is a web app that runs exclusively in your browser. As such, it only saves your drawings to your browser's local storage. This means that if you clear your browser's cache, or if you use a different browser, you will lose all of your drawings.

This version of Excalidraw saves your drawings to your personal cloud. This means that you can access your drawings from any device.

## Planned Features

- Handling of multiple drawings
- Ability to share a view-only version of the drawing
- Auto-export to png/svg, with a shareable link
- Teletype-like launcher to control the app

## Limitations

As long as deta will not support websockets, the live-collaboration feature will not be available. If you want to collaborate with other people, consider subscribing to [Excalidraw+](https://plus.excalidraw.com/).
